 ## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profile securely. It ensures that user data is protected and forms the foundation for personalized interactions throughout the platform.

### 2. Property Management
Property owners can create, update, and manage listings with details like location, pricing, and availability. This feature enables the core functionality of hosting within the platform.

### 3. Booking System
Users can browse properties and make reservations by selecting available dates. This system ensures accurate availability tracking and handles the booking lifecycle from request to confirmation.

### 4. Payment Processing
Secure online payments are handled through integrated services. This feature enables users to pay for bookings and ensures transaction tracking and confirmation.

### 5. Review System
After a stay, users can rate and review properties. This promotes trust and transparency between users and property owners, improving the overall user experience.

### 6. Data Optimization
The system uses indexing and caching to enhance database performance. This ensures that users experience fast load times and efficient access to information. 

## Features Overview
1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.
7. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is essential to protect sensitive data, ensure application integrity, and maintain user trust. The following security measures will be implemented across the application:

### Authentication
All users must authenticate using secure methods such as token-based authentication (e.g., JWT). This ensures that only verified users can access protected resources and perform authorized actions.

### Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to ensure that users can only perform actions permitted by their role (e.g., host vs. guest). This prevents unauthorized access to critical operations such as editing property listings or viewing booking histories.

### Rate Limiting
To protect against abuse and brute-force attacks, rate limiting will be applied to restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specified timeframe. This reduces the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and conserves system resources.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This ensures the integrity of the application and protects backend systems from malicious input.

### HTTPS Enforcement
All communications between the client and server will be encrypted using HTTPS. This protects user credentials, payment details, and other sensitive data from being intercepted during transmission.

### Why Security is Crucial for Key Areas

**User Data**: Personal information like emails, passwords, and phone numbers must be secured to protect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations.
**Payments**: Financial transactions must be processed securely to prevent fraud, theft, and loss of trust.
**Booking System**: Unauthorized access to booking data can disrupt business logic and lead to misuse of resources.
**Property Listings**: Only authorized users should be able to create or modify listings to maintain platform integrity and prevent abuse.
